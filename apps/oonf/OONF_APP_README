The OONF App executable loads everything from dynamic libraries, including the subsystems.

Because of this you should run it with the following minimal configuration:

[global]
    plugin   class
    plugin   clock
    plugin   socket
    plugin   timer
    plugin   os_clock
    plugin   os_fd
    plugin   os_system
