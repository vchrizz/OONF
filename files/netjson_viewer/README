The netjson viewer is a minimal way to visualize the live-topology of olsrd2.

It uses the vis.js API (http://visjs.or) and an XMLHttpRequest to load data from
olsrd2 during runtime from the netjsoninfo plugin.

As a minimal solution to use this plugin put vis.js, vis.css, netjson_view.js
on a webserver and adapt the links in netjson_view.html to it.

Put netjson_view.html in the /tmp/www directory of your node. It needs to be on
the same IP as the olsrd2, because otherwise the XMLHttpRequest will be blocked
as a crosssite-script attack.

Compile olsrd2 with http plugin and allow it to publish the content of /tmp/www.

[http]
    bindto        0.0.0.0
    webserver     /tmp/www

After this you should get the viewer by accessing

http://<ip-of-olsrd2-node>:1980/www/netjson_view.html
